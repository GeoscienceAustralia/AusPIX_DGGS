# AusPIX_DGGS
The AusPIX DGGS is an Australian Government implimentation of the rHealpix DGGS engine.

Date: June 2019

Included in this repository is the rHealPIX "engine" and a series of scripts that use AusPIX in a variety of ways.
Wrapper scripts developed by Bell, J.G. at Geoscience Australia.

Some speed enhancements by CSIRO under contract.

Funded by the Australian Government Loc-I Project

Initial guidance by Matt Purss

rHealPIX DGGS engine developed by Gibb, R.G et al

Additionally there are several 'callable' modules that perform common tasks in DGGS space. These are in the "callable_modules" folder.
